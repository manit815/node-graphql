# node-graphql

Learning graphql with node.

GraphQL has been something which I have been trying to experiment with for quite sometime now. I have followed [https://www.howtographql.com/]

The project includes Prisma and Apollo Server.

Prisma is an open source database toolkit. 

Apollo server is a GraphQL server which is based on Express.js. This server is quite feature right.
